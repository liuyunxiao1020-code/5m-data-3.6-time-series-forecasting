# Assignment

## Instructions

In this assignment, you will apply time series forecasting techniques to analyze and predict future values. You will work with the "Global Temperature Time Series" dataset, which contains monthly temperature anomalies from 1880 to present day.

### Task: Global Temperature Forecasting

Your task is to analyze the global temperature time series and build forecasting models to predict future temperature trends. Follow these steps:

1. **Data Exploration**

   - Load and prepare the dataset
   - Visualize the time series data
   - Check for trends, seasonality, and cycles
   - Create seasonal plots and subseries plots
   - Analyze autocorrelation using ACF plots

2. **Time Series Decomposition**

   - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
   - Compare additive and multiplicative decomposition methods
   - Interpret your findings

3. **Forecasting**

   - Split the data into training and testing sets using a temporal split
   - Implement and evaluate the following forecasting methods:
     - Naive forecasting (last value and seasonal naive)
     - ARIMA/SARIMA models
     - Exponential smoothing models
   - Use appropriate evaluation metrics (MAE, MAPE, sMAPE) to compare model performance

4. **Model Selection and Interpretation**
   - Determine which model performs best for this dataset
   - Interpret the results and explain why certain models might work better than others
   - Generate forecasts for future periods
